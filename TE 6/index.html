    <p>
      In this chapter, I learned how to test the code solutions in JavaScript with three different exercises:<br><br>
       <b>Exercise 1: Looping Triangle</b> <br>
      Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:<br><br>
      <b>Exercise 2: FizzBuzz</b><br>
      Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.<br><br>
      <b>Exercise 3: Chessboard</b><br>
      Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.<br>

    <div>
      <button type="button" onclick="myAlert()">Finish!</button>
    </div>
    <script>
    function myAlert() {
      alert("GOOD JOB!");
      }
    </script>
  </body>
