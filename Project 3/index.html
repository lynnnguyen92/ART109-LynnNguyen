      In this project, I create a 3D model of the labyrinth building based on a QR code. Nowadays, QR code is very popular and people usually use it to share information. I want to use the meaning of QR to create a space that promotes sharing and networking, especially to engage the audiences in online art. When the viewers first enter the space, they will explore a city with different shapes and sizes, but if we look at it from the bottom and the top, it will look like a QR code. I also add the animation and transparent texture which make people feel like walking in a virtual space.<br><br>

      Javascript libraries: Three.Module.js, Three.Min.js, GLTFLoader.js, PointerLockControls.js, animation.
