My "world building" idea is creating a maze based on QR code.
      QR code which stands for “quick response” are capable of storing lots of data.
      I want to use the meaning of QR to create a space that promote sharing and networking, especially to engages the audiences to online art.
In this project, I will create a 3D model of the labyrinth building.
      From the top perspective, it will look like a QR code, but if we rotate it around,
      it will be a maze city. I will also add some artworks and some different
      QR code designs on the wall of the buildings.
