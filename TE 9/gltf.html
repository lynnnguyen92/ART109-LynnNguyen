    <h1> Three.js: GLTF Model Loader and Orbit Controls</h1>
    <h2>

    <p>
      In this exercise, I'm trying to combine GLTF Model and Orbit Controls Example. I also set up Key Controls to move around the object. <br />
      <br />Here are some obstacles that I have while doing this exercise: <br />
      - Loading the brick texture from blender to three.js scene</br>
      - Applying the PointerLockControls on 3D model<br>
      - Setting up the key controls to match the view of camera rotation

    <!--client2.js selects the div with an id of "space" and places the scene within it.-->
